This could represent a situation where processing needs to stop because of a significant error or anomaly.\n",

If so, we add it to `threshold_voltages` and then use `continue` to skip the remaining code in the loop, moving directly to the next iteration. This ensures that threshold voltages are not also classified as safe voltages.\n",

This could be where you'd implement additional logic, such as logging these measurements for further analysis. For now, it does nothing but serves as a placeholder for future code.\n"

    "**Scenario**: In a water treatment process, the optimal chemical dosage for treating a batch of water depends on various factors like water quality parameters (e.g., pH, turbidity) and chemical concentration. The goal is to iteratively adjust the chemical dosage based on the water quality outcome, aiming for a target quality level with minimal chemical usage.\n",
