    "\n",
    "You are a structural engineer responsible for selecting a beam to support a load. You know the beam is subjected to a uniform load. It is your job to create a function that will calculate the minimum beam design specifications to ensure that the beam will not yield under the expected load.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stress, $\\sigma$, on a beam subjected to a uniform load is given by the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma = \\frac{M y}{I} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $M$ is the moment of the force applied to the beam (in Newton-meters, Nm),\n",
    "- $y$ is the distance from the neutral axis to the point at which the stress is being calculated (in meters, m),\n",
    "- $I$ is the moment of inertia of the beam's cross-sectional area (in meters to the fourth power, m\\(^4\\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "When selecting a beam it is important to be able to include a safety factor in the design. The safety factor is a multiplier that is applied to the calculated stress to ensure that the beam will not fail under the expected load.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the stress on the beam is sigma, the required design specifications including the safety factor are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma_{\\text{yield}} = \\text{Safety Factor} \\times \\sigma $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Write Python code to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define a function called `beam_stress` which accepts three input arguments: `M`, `y`, and `I`, and a fourth optional argument called `safety_factor` which defaults to 1.0.\n",
    "* Define a variable called `sigma` and set it equal to the result of the equation above.\n",
    "* Define a variable called `sigma_yield` and set it equal to the result of the equation above.\n",
    "* Have your function print the response: `The stress on the beam is: <sigma> N/m^2, and the required beam yield strength is <sigma_yield> N/m^2`, where sigma, and sigma yield are the integer values of the variable for the stress on the beam and yield strength respectively.\n",
    "* Implement your function so that it returns the stress on a beam for the given inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide an example usage of your function by calling it with the following inputs:\n",
    "* `M = 1000` Nm\n",
    "* `y = 0.1` m\n",
    "* `I = 0.0001` m\\(^4\\)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code should print the response: \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You can control the precision of the output by using string formatting to round the output to a specific number of decimal places. For example, to round the output to 2 decimal places, you can use the following code:\n",

This can cause there to be local variables needed for your solution that would not be recreated on running your code again from scratch. Your assignment will be graded based on running your code from scratch. This means before you submit your assignment you should restart the kernel and run all cells. You can do this by clicking `Kernel` and selecting `Restart and Run All`. If you code does not run as expected after restarting the kernel and running all cells it means you have an error in your code. \n",
