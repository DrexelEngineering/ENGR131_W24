    "# ðŸ’» Activity: Building a Sensor Class\n",
    "\n",
    "In manufacturing, you might be required to build software for a sensor. We will build a sensor with a name, a current value, a warning threshold, and alarm threshold. The sensor should return a string when the warning or alarm threshold is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will provide you with guidance on how to build this class. As you progress with coding, it is expected that you are able to write functional code with objectives but without specific instructions. Please add code where the `...` are located\n"
