    "# ðŸ’» Activity: Building the game LCR\n",
    "\n",
    "Left-Center-Right (also known as LCR) is a simple dice game that can be played with any number of players, making it a great option for parties or family gatherings. The game requires three six-sided dice and a handful of chips or other small items to use as currency. Here are the rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each player starts with three chips.\n",
    "- The game begins with each player rolling the three dice.\n",
    "- The result of the roll determines what action each player must take:\n",
    "  - If a player rolls an \"L,\" they must pass one chip to the player on their left.\n",
    "  - If a player rolls an \"R,\" they must pass one chip to the player on their right.\n",
    "  - If a player rolls a \"C,\" they must put one chip into the center pot.\n",
    "  - If a player rolls a number, they keep their chips for that round.\n",
    "- The game continues with each player rolling the dice and following the corresponding action until only one player has any chips left.\n",
    "- The player with chips remaining is the winner and collects all the chips from the center pot.\n",
    "- If a player runs out of chips, they are out of the game. \n",
    "- If a player has only one chip left, they only roll one dice.\n",
    "- Players can agree to increase the number of chips each player starts with or add other variations to the game to make it more interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! LCR is a quick and easy game to learn, but it can be surprisingly addictive and competitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will build this game using classes an inheritance. Again, we will be practicing your ability to problem solve in code. \n"
