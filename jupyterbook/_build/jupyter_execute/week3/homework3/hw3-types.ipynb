This can cause there to be local variables needed for your solution that would not be recreated on running your code again from scratch. Your assignment will be graded based on running your code from scratch. This means before you submit your assignment you should restart the kernel and run all cells. You can do this by clicking `Kernel` and selecting `Restart and Run All`. If you code does not run as expected after restarting the kernel and running all cells it means you have an error in your code. \n",
