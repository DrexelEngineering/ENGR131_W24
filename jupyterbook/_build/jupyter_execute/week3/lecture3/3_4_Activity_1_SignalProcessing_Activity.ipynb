    "Imagine you are designing a program to manage the indoor temperature of a building to keep students and employees productive. The program analyzes the temperature in a room over time to know how much warm or cool air to add using the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system. This data is critical for monitoring the machine's performance and predicting maintenance needs."
