    "**Question 1: Thermal Expansion of a Rod**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a materials engineer tasked with evaluating the suitability of a metal rod for use in a construction project where temperature variations are significant. It's essential to estimate the thermal expansion of the rod to ensure that it will not cause structural issues due to temperature changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The change in length, $\\Delta L$, of a rod due to thermal expansion can be calculated using the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta L = \\alpha L_0 \\Delta T \\tag{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\alpha$ is the coefficient of thermal expansion of the material (in per degree Celsius, $°C^{-1}$),\n",
    "- $L_0$ is the original length of the rod (in meters, m),\n",
    "- $\\Delta T$ is the change in temperature (in degrees Celsius, °C).\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the structural integrity of the construction, it's crucial to consider a tolerance factor in the design. This factor adjusts the expected change in length to account for uncertainties in material properties and temperature variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the change in length is $\\Delta L$, the adjusted length change including the tolerance factor is given by:\n",

    "* Define a variable called `DeltaL` and set it equal to the result of equation (1) above.\n",
    "* Define a variable called `DeltaL_adjusted` and set it equal to the result of the equation (2) above.\n",
    "* Have your function print the response: `The change in length of the rod is: <DeltaL> m, and the adjusted length change for tolerance is <DeltaL_adjusted> m`, where `<DeltaL>`, and `<DeltaL_adjusted>` are the float values of the variable for the change in length and the adjusted change respectively, rounded to 3 decimal places.\n",

    "**Question 2: Identifying the First Acidic Solution with pH Below a Certain Level 5**\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python function `acidic_pH_detection` that takes a sequence of pH level measurements (represented as a list of floats) as a variable `pH_levels`. The goal is to identify the first measurement that falls below a predefined `threshold` value, indicating the occurrence of an acidic solution. Once an acidic solution with a pH below the threshold is found, the program should return the *index* (position) of this measurement in the dataset and the *value* of the pH level, as a tuple then terminate the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "1. Write a function `acidic_pH_detection` that takes two input arguments: `pH_levels` (a list of floats) and `threshold` (a float).\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Use a for loop to iterate through the `pH_levels` list.\n",
    "   2. Within the loop, implement a condition to check if the current pH level is below the threshold.\n",
    "   3. Print the index of the first pH level that is below the threshold and the value of this pH level. The print statement should read `First acidic solution detected below threshold found at index <index> with pH <value>.`, where <index> and <value> are the index and pH level of the first measurement below the threshold.\n",
    "   4. If a pH level below the threshold is found, use a return statement to exit the loop immediately and return a tuple containing the index of the measurement and the value of the pH level.\n",
    "   5. If no pH level below the threshold is detected, print a message: `No acidic solution was detected below the threshold of <threshold>.`, where <threshold> is the value of the threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Test your function by calling it with the provided inputs. Save the output of the function call to a variable `acidic_solution`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "* Use the `enumerate()` function to get both the index and the value of each item when iterating through the list with a for loop."
