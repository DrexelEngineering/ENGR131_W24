In this class we will expect that all of your work follows instructions exactly. We will provide many ways for you to check that you have not made a simple mistake in your assignments; however, just like a computer program if you do not follow instructions exactly, you may not receive credit for your work. It is important that you read and understand all instructions for all assignments. \n",

If you click on the yellow dot, you can see the progress of the autograder. This will take a few minutes to complete. Once complete, this will change to a checkmark.\n",

    "In python and particularly jupyter notebooks it is common that during testing you run cells in a different order, or run cells and modify them. This can cause there to be local variables needed for your solution that would not be recreated on running your code again from scratch. Your assignment will be graded based on running your code from scratch. This means before you submit your assignment you should restart the kernel and run all cells. You can do this by clicking `Kernel` and selecting `Restart and Run All`. If you code does not run as expected after restarting the kernel and running all cells it means you have an error in your code. \n",
