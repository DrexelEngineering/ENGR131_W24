In this class we will expect that all of your work follows instructions exactly. We will provide many ways for you to check that you have not made a simple mistake in your assignments, however, just like a computer program if you do not follow instructions exactly you may not receive credit for your work. It is important that you read and understand all instructions for all assignments. \n",

Due to the size of the class we will be using an automatic grading system. Upon submission your assignment will be graded, and a score file will appear in your git repository. This score file will tell you if you have passed all of the tests. If you have not passed all of the tests you can resubmit your assignment as many times as you would like before the due date. Assignments will not be accepted after the due date unless prior arrangements have been made with the instructors. "
