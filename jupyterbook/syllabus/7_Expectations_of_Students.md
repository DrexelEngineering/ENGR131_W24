# Expectations of Students #

We expect all students to fully participate in all aspects of the course. Each activity and assignment are designed to encourage learning and success in the course.

## Pre-Class Session Readings

Prior to class all students are expected to complete the reading and learning activities within ZyBooks. This content is selected to familiarize you with the core concepts that will be built upon in class sessions. Completing these assignments prior to class sessions will ensure you are able to use class sessions to begin applying the concepts and identifying misconceptions.

## Class Sessions

We will have 2-hour class sessions once a week. Class sessions will be used to expand upon the material learned in Zybooks. In class sessions, you will work with your peers to apply the concepts learned in Zybooks.

## Homework

Every week you will be expected to complete an individual homework assignment. These assignments will be designed for you to demonstrate independent mastery of the material covered in pre-class session readings and class sessions. These assignments are designed so you can wrestle with the concepts to build a strong understanding. While it is allowed, and expected that you talk with your colleagues about the homework, your submitted work should be completed independently. When completing homework, it is acceptable to talk about code, or even look at each others' code; however, it is not acceptable to share or copy sections of code from one another or any other source.

## Labs

The lab provides an opportunity for you to challenge yourself on more complex problems. You will build confidence by tackling these challenging problems. Attendance is an essential part of developing mastery in the class. 

## Quizzes

In the first half of lab classes you will have a practical quiz testing your understanding of concepts covered in the course. Please make sure to bring a charged laptop with a web camera to every lab session. If you have financial hardships that prevent you from having a laptop, please contact the instructor, loaner laptops are available for students in need. If you miss a quiz without an approved excuse, you will receive a zero for that quiz.

## Midterm and Final

The midterm and final will be designed to demonstrate individual mastery and connections between concepts taught. This will be a common exam at 08:00 am on Monday, February 5, which will be completed using a combination of pen and paper, online true or false, and practical coding.
