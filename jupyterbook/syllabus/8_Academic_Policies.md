# Academic Policies

## Course-Specific Policies 

### Homework and Lab Assignment Policy

Homework is always to be submitted on or before the date on which it is due. **Homework and labs submitted after the due date will not be accepted.** Homework must be submitted using the method described and practiced in Week 1. Assignments submitted using another mechanism will not be graded.

## Examination Policy

All quizzes and exams in the course are closed-textbook and closed-"reading assignment material" and will be monitored using a proctoring software. Use of other books or any other material (such as solutions to homework assignments) is not permitted. Use of cell phones, laptops, tablets, PDAs, or any other device capable of wireless communication is prohibited, unless it is the device on which the exam will be taken or instructions otherwise are provided. Exams will cover material discussed in the class sessions, homework assignments, or textbook sections given as reading assignments. For example, the exams may include questions on material covered in class sessions or homework but not specifically covered in the textbook. Similarly, the exams may include any material covered in a section of the textbook given as a reading assignment but not specifically covered in the class sessions or homework.

## Absentee Policy

Absence from labs and examinations will be excused only under extraordinary circumstances such as religious observances or emergencies of a medical or family nature. A missed lab or examination without prior approval and without legitimate reason will be graded at zero points (quiz portion of lab grade). An absence will be excused only if the student is able to provide legitimate documentation. Special examinations will not be held earlier or on later dates to accommodate, for example, flight schedules for overseas vacations.

## University Academic Policies

### Missed Classes

It is essential to your success in this course that you attend each class and laboratory session and participate in the activities and discussions. Therefore, you are expected to attend each class session and to show up on time. If you miss a class session for a University-approved reason, the professors will make reasonable efforts to provide missed material.

### Academic Integrity, Plagiarism and Cheating Policy**

NO PERMITTED USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS IN THIS COURSE: Artificial intelligence tools
such as large language models (e.g., ChatGPT) are *not permitted* to be used in preparing submitted work for this
course. Further information on university policies regarding the use of artificial intelligence tools in the classroom
is available in the Draft Drexel University Policy on Academic Integrity Pertaining to Artificial Intelligence.

Each student is expected to complete all assignments independently unless otherwise explicitly instructed. It is unacceptable to copy another student's work or solutions from any other source. Submitted assignments will be checked for plagiarism using Stanford's MOSS plagiarism detection system (<https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/>). Violators of this policy will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards (SCCS). Academic integrity violations could result in failure for the course or the assignment among other sanctions determined by the instructor. A second violation of the academic integrity policy will likely result in suspension. Please review the University's policy regarding academic integrity at:

### Regrade Policy

If you are of the opinion you deserve more credit than provided to you for an assignment, email to [engr131.w24@drexel.edu](mailto:engr131.w24@drexel.edu) an explanation of why you are of the opinion you desire additional credit within *one week* of receiving the graded assignment. You are welcome to discuss homework questions or concerns with the Professors or TAs prior to submitting request for regrading. Grade modifications will only happen after a formal request is submitted.

### Students with Learning Differences

Profs. Capps and Agar welcomes individuals with learning differences and is committed to ensuring equal access so that all students can live, learn, and lead at Drexel.
To [request accommodations](https://drexel.edu/disability-resources/support-accommodations/student-family-resources/), a current Accommodations Verification Letter (AVL) in the [ClockWork database](http://accommodate.drexel.edu/ClockWork/) is required before accommodations can be made. These requests are received by [Disability Resources (DR)](https://drexel.edu/disability-resources/), who then issues the AVL to the appropriate contacts. For additional information, visit the Disability Resources website, or contact DR for more information by phone at 215.895.1401, or by email at <disability@drexel.edu>.

Students who are approved for accommodations at Drexel should share this letter and discuss their accommodations and learning needs with instructors as early in the semester as possible.
Profs. Capps and Agar will do everything possible to accommodate students needs.
If you feel that your accommodations are not being met, please make sure to contact [engr131.w24@drexel.edu](mailto:engr131.w24@drexel.edu).

The instructors understand that there are inequities in access to testing required to get approved for accommodations. If you feel that you have learning difference that influence equity in your classroom performance please reach out to Profs. Capps and Agar at [engr131.w24@drexel.edu](mailto:engr131.w24@drexel.edu). They will work with you to try and accommodate your learning differences.

### Course Drop Policy

[http://drexel.edu/provost/policies/course-add-drop/](http://drexel.edu/provost/policies/course-add-drop/)

### Course Withdrawal Policy

[http://drexel.edu/provost/policies/course-withdrawal/](http://drexel.edu/provost/policies/course-withdrawal/)

### Course Change Policy

The instructors reserves the right to modify the course, as necessary, during the term: including policies, evaluations, due dates, course content, schedule, assignments or requirements. All changes will be communicated in class sessions and/or *via* the course *DrexelLearn* page.

### Weather, Emergencies and University Closing

University closing or delayed opening information will be posted on [www.drexel.edu.](http://www.drexel.edu/) In the event of the need to close or delay the daily opening of a campus, the University will provide notice *via* Web, telephone, and the DrexelALERT system. Closing or delayed opening information will be announced at 215-895-MELT (6358). The University determines whether to close or delay opening due to inclement weather, not the instructor. Therefore, please do not contact the instructor for this information.

### Religious Observances

Profs. Capps and Agar extends hospitality to all persons regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, economic or social background.

Profs. Capps and Agar honors the free exercise of religion. People from a wide variety of religious traditions live and work at Drexel, and the demands of religious observance in some traditions may cause conflicts with classroom and work schedules.

Profs. Capps and Agar will exempt any person who requests an absence due to the demands of religious holiday observance. Of course, nothing exempts a student from meeting course requirements or completing assignments, so the student will have to work with the instructor any make-up work.

Accommodations are to be dealt with on the basis of individual requests from students. Recall that religious holidays are numerous, and no holiday is privileged above another.

If you encounter a schedule conflict with your course work due to the demands of religious observance, here is what you should do:

- Email [engr131.w24@drexel.edu](mailto:engr131.w24@drexel.edu), and indicate that you will be absent from class due to observance of religious holidays.
- Arrange with the instructor to complete assignments.

For any further questions please refer to Drexel’s [Religious Accommodation Policy](https://drexel.edu/oed/diversity/religious-accommodations/)

### Extended Absences

In the event of extended absence where several classes have been missed, students should explore options other than those described above, such as requesting an Incomplete grade (please reference the [Incomplete Grades Policy](https://drexel.edu/provost/policies-calendars/policies/incomplete_grades/)) or withdrawal (please reference the [Course Withdrawal Policy](https://drexel.edu/provost/policies-calendars/policies/course-withdrawal/)). It is strongly recommended that students consult with their academic advisor to determine the best course of action given the circumstances, academic progression, and goals.

In the event of an extended absence due to a chronic medical condition or disability, students are strongly advised to contact (1) the [Office of Disability Resources](https://drexel.edu/disability-resources/about/overview/) to explore potential accommodations that may be available and (2) their academic advisor to explore possible academic options. A student's academic advisor can review policies governing such options as withdrawal or incomplete grade and discuss the potential impact of electing these options.

### COVID-19

We are in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic. We want to ensure the safety of our community. As a result, if you feel as if you are exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms, please follow the [appropriate procedures for Drexel students](https://drexel.edu/coronavirus/health-safety/COVID-19-testing/). Instructors will be alerted of excused absences through the corresponding Drexel channels.

### Equity and Inclusion

#### Gender and Sexual Identity

People commonly use gender and sexual orientation as part of their identity. Since English uses gendered pronouns, one way we will cultivate respect in the class and lab sessions will be to opt for using a person's name or gender-agnostic pronouns to indicate that person unless that person has directly shared particular pronouns of preference.  Profs. Capps and Agar will not tolerate any bias or discrimination based on a person's likeness or identity.

### Student Code of Conduct

Student Conduct & Care seeks to create and maintain a process that is transparent and equitable for Students and Student Organizations. The policies and process described on this website have, in some cases, been paraphrased to provide a general understanding. The [full Code of Conduct (the Code)](https://drexel.edu/studentlife/~/media/Drexel/Sites/StudentLife/Documents/community-standards/Drexel-University-Code-of-Conduct.ashx) can be downloaded for review.

Conduct Creed
Student Conduct & Care has established, in accordance with its mission, vision, and values, a code of high standards of behavior to include the following expectations for Students and Student Organizations to:

- Accept responsibility when their choices or actions have negatively impacted themselves, others, or the community at large.
- Engage in constant learning, practice self-reflection, and develop resilience to maintain academic, personal, and professional integrity.
- Foster positive relationships with others.
- Ensure the health, wellness, and safety of themselves and their communities.
- Demonstrate mutual respect and equity within the bounds of the Code of Conduct.

#### Defining Drexel's Culture of Inclusion

At Drexel University, we are committed to fostering an inclusive and welcoming environment based on integrity, trust, and respect. We view the diversity of our students, faculty, professional staff, and partners as our strength. As such, we strive to create a culture where everyone can leverage their uniqueness to foster innovation because they feel a sense of belonging.

We define diversity as the differences that make us uniquely who we are. This includes both individual (personality, values, attitudes, etc.) and other dimensions of difference including ideological, intellectual, economic, gender, gender identity, ability, sexual orientation, religious, age, racial, cultural, ethnic, visible and invisible disabilities, veteran status, nationality, and all the diversity of our students, faculty, professional staff, alumni, and other partners.

To maximize the strength that our diversity brings, we center equity, inclusion and belonging, and incorporate an anti-racism approach to our strategic plan, organizational systems, policies, and structures.

##### Anti-racism

The active process of identifying and ending racism by changing our organizational systems, policies and structures to redistribute power and resources more equitably among all individuals, both at the personal and systemic levels.

##### Belonging

A sense of psychological safety that affords the ability for each member of the Drexel University community to be their authentic self without fear of judgement, where everyone can perform at their best because they feel accepted, respected, valued, and heard.

##### Equity

The process by which we aim to achieve fairness through reallocation of University resources and opportunities such that policies, structures, and their implementation work to eliminate historical, systemic disadvantage for the benefit of everyone. This requires providing varying levels of support both at the individual and systemic levels.

##### Inclusion

We adopt [Association of American Colleges and Universities'](https://www.aacu.org/making-excellence-inclusive) definition of inclusion as: The active, intentional, and ongoing engagement with diversity—in the curriculum, in the cocurriculum, and in communities (intellectual, social, cultural, geographical) with which individuals might connect—in ways that increase awareness, content knowledge, cognitive sophistication, and empathic understanding of the complex ways individuals interact within systems and institutions.

##### Institutional Racism

Institutional polices, processes and biased practices that favor white people over Black, Indigenous, and People of Color.

##### Racism

Racial prejudice based on unfounded beliefs and irrational fear combined with institutional power. This can be at the individual level (conscious and subconscious beliefs and actions that promote racism), the interpersonal level (racist slurs or actions), and systemic level (in institutions).
