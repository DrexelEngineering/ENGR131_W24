## Class Forum

This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and Professors. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, we encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. Join our class page at: <https://piazza.com/drexel/winter2024/engr131>.

_Homework_: Post in appropriate area in Piazza only necessary code (without solutions).

_Lab_: Learning Assistant or Teaching Assistant for your lab section

_Exams, Regrades_: [engr131.w24@drexel.edu](mailto:engr131.w24@drexel.edu) (monitored by the Instructors); regrade requests must be submitted with written documentation of the error in grading and the specific points requested revised within one week of the exam being returned.
