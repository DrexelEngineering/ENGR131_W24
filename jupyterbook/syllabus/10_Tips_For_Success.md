# Tips for Success

 Be proactive about your success in the course!  If you need help, there are many resources available to help you. Your first primary contact for help is the learning assistants, the teaching assistants, and then the instructors. If you are struggling, attend office hours or send an email. Do not wait to bring issues, course related or otherwise, to the attention of the instructors. If you cannot attend office hours, send an email to [engr131.w24@drexel.edu](mailto:engr131.w24@drexel.edu) to try to make other arrangements.

* Be proactive about your success in the course.
* Do not procrastinate! Begin your assignments and studying early!
* Attend every class.
* Ask questions whether it is during class, lab, office hours, or via email to your instructor.
* Form a study group! Working together will help you and others better understand the course material as you can work through different difficulties and offer each other clarifications on concepts.
* Do problems! Reading through Zybooks and your notes is not enough. Seek out new problems and work through them carefully. When you are done, check your answer. If you are wrong, examine carefully what misunderstanding occurred and how to avoid it in the future. If you were correct, examine if there was a faster way, check to see if your solution _flowed and was easy to read_, and think over what concepts/computations were used and what _type_ of problem the exercise was.
