# Counseling Services

College can be a time of uncertainty, inquiry, expansion, and adaptation for many students. Know that my office and conversations with the instructors are a safe place. Personal information told to the instructors in private will remain confidential.

The only exceptions are sexual misconduct or if I feel that you are at risk of harming yourself or others. If these issues are disclosed to the instructors, we have an obligation to report.

If an issues arises, the instructors will do our best to facilitate you getting the help you need to resolve your issues. We encourage you to make use of the access you have to the [Office of Counseling and Health Services](https://drexel.edu/counselingandhealth/counseling-center/overview/).

## GROUP COUNSELING

The Counseling Center offers a variety of groups each quarter. Some groups are time-limited with a specific focus, while others are broader and open-ended. Please see the group descriptions here for more information about groups currently offered at the Center. If you are interested in joining a group that is not currently being offered, please email <counsel@drexel.edu>.

## INDIVIDUAL COUNSELING

The personal concerns of Drexel students vary greatly, and our Counseling Center offers goal-focused individual counseling for support. Students initially meet with a therapist for an assessment to discuss their presenting concerns and to determine the type of services which will best meet their needs.

## WELLNESS WORKSHOPS

The Counseling Center offers several Emotional Wellbeing Workshops throughout the term that offer information, coping strategies, and tools to address common concerns faced by college students. We know that Drexel students are incredibly busy and can benefit from quick and useful tools for common presenting concerns. Workshops meet once a week for a series of 3-4 weeks for 50 minutes. Our Wellness Workshops are formatted so that you can expect a classroom-style learning environment, and you can share as much or as little as you want. Each workshop comes with a student workbook that allows you to practice new skills between sessions. Click here to see which Workshops are currently being offered.

If you are interested in attending any (or all!) of the workshops, schedule an Initial Consultation and tell your counselor. If you are already seeing a therapist at the Counseling Center, tell them you are interested in a workshop. You are free to do more than one workshop and to repeat them as often as you like! Check with the front desk for current scheduling and availability. When scheduled for an Emotional Wellbeing Workshop, you must come to each session on time, as the sessions build upon each other.

## COUPLES COUNSELING

Couples counseling is available for students and their partners if both are currently enrolled as full-time students at Drexel University. If your partner is not enrolled at Drexel, you may contact us for information on community referral resources.

## OUTREACH PROGRAMS

The Counseling Center offers a variety of outreach to campus partners - including faculty and staff, student groups, and campus organizations - to promote wellness and resiliency, destigmatize mental health, and offer preventative interventions using a social justice lens. To schedule an outreach or for more information, please visit here.

## CONSULTATION

If you are concerned about a friend, student or family member; want advice about how to encourage someone you care about to get help; or you have general questions about our services; contact the Counseling Center at 215.895.1415 to request a consultation. We will have a counselor contact you to discuss further.

For faculty and staff who may wish to consult with a counselor, or who want to learn more about how and when to make a referral, please see our Faculty and Staff Resource section.

## REFERRAL SERVICES

Our Case Manager is available for students who would like assistance connecting with an off-campus mental health provider. The Counseling Center may make a recommendation for a student to be referred off-campus when a student may be better suited for specialized care and/or when the student’s needs fall outside the scope of the Center’s brief, goal-focused model. Our Case Manager also assists in navigating insurance and helping think through the type of care and provider you might be interested in working with in the community. The Case Manager will also be sure to follow up with you to see if you need any further assistance.

**If you are currently in crisis, please contact our on-call counselor at 215.416.3337. If this is a psychological emergency and you need immediate attention, please dial 911, call Drexel Public Safety at 215.895.2222, or visit your nearest emergency room.**
